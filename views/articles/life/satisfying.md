# Life / Satisfying

## 3-5 word subheading/tagline here

### Quality of Life
Some bozo text here based on what's in the google doc.

### Healthy Living
In Greenville, options for eating and living healthy abound. Two major hospital systems care for our community, while year-round and seasonal farmers markets offer fresh food from local farmers. Greenville is also home to the first official Slow Food Earth Market in the US (http://www.earthmarkets.net/network/greenville).

### Green Spaces
Whether you're an avid outdoorsman or a just want like to hang out at the park with your kids, Greenville has outdoor space for everyone. Ride or walk the 15 mile Swamp Rabbit trail through downtown, and stop at Falls Park to admire the suspension bridge. At the heart of this lush park is the Reedy River, complete with a natural waterfall and plenty of benches to sit and admire it from. The zoo is the perfect place for families; after a visit with the animals, take some time to chill at neighboring Cleveland Park. There's plenty of open space for a game of ultimate frisbee, and your canine friends will enjoy the half-acre dog park. For 
the cycling enthusiast, bike paths are prevalent through downtown with more being added all the time. Want to take a hike? With beautiful Paris Mountain State Park 20 minutes away, and a just short drive past that to the Blue Ridge Mountains, Greenville has enough trails to satisfy any explorer.

### Out and About
Shopping in Greenville means supporting small business owners as well as larger retail stores — like the Apple Store — that are typically reserved for larger markets. All the big box stores along with boutiques and specialty shops are only a few minutes from downtown. And closer to home, a walk down Main Street allows you to stop by the bank, purchase homemade cupcakes, find a one-of-a kind gift, and make a quick stop at the pharmacy before meeting friends for drinks. It's the best of both worlds.
