## Quality of life

### Healthy Living
In Greenville, options for eating and living healthy abound. Two major hospital systems care for our community in addition to holistic and alternative practices. Year-round and seasonal farmers markets as well as the new Swamp Rabbit Cafe & Grocery offer fresh food from local farmers. Healthy supermarkets including Earth Fare and Whole Foods provide a wide variety of organic foods. Greenville is also home to the first official [Slow Food Earth Market](http://www.earthmarkets.net/network/greenville) in the US .

### Green Spaces
Whether you're an avid outdoorsman or a just want to hang out at the park with your kids, Greenville has outdoor space for everyone. Ride or walk the 15 mile Swamp Rabbit trail through downtown, and stop at Falls Park to admire the suspension bridge and natural waterfalls. Visit the zoo and neighboring Cleveland Park, there’s plenty of open space and your canine friends will enjoy the half-acre dog park. For the cycling enthusiast, bike lanes are prevalent through downtown with more being added all the time. Want to take a hike? Beautiful Paris Mountain State Park is 20 minutes away, and it’s just a short drive past that to the Blue Ridge Mountains.

### Out and About
Shopping in Greenville means supporting small business owners as well as larger retail stores — like the Apple Store — that are typically reserved for larger markets. All the big box stores along with boutiques and specialty shops are only a few minutes from downtown. And closer to home, a walk down Main Street allows you to stop by the bank, purchase homemade cupcakes, find a one-of-a kind gift, and make a quick stop at the pharmacy before meeting friends for drinks. It's the best of both worlds.
