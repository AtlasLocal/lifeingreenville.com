### Quality of Life
Some bozo text here based on what's in the google doc.

### Healthy Living
In Greenville, options for eating and living healthy abound. Two major hospital systems care for our community, while year-round and seasonal farmers markets offer fresh food from local farmers. Greenville is also home to the first official Slow Food Earth Market in the US (http://www.earthmarkets.net/network/greenville).

### Green Spaces
Whether you're an avid outdoorsman or a just want like to hang out at the park with your kids, Greenville has outdoor space for everyone. Ride or walk the 15 mile Swamp Rabbit trail through downtown, and stop at Falls Park to admire the suspension bridge. At the heart of this lush park is the Reedy River, complete with a natural waterfall and plenty of benches to sit and admire it from. The zoo is the perfect place for families; after a visit with the animals, take some time to chill at neighboring Cleveland Park. There's plenty of open space for a game of ultimate frisbee, and your canine friends will enjoy the half-acre dog park. For 
the cycling enthusiast, bike paths are prevalent through downtown with more being added all the time. Want to take a hike? With beautiful Paris Mountain State Park 20 minutes away , and a just short drive past that to the Blue Ridge Mountains, Greenville has enough trails to satisfy any explorer.

### Shopping
Shopping in Greenville means supporting small business owners as well as larger retail stores — like Trader Joe's and the Apple Store — typically reserved for larger markets. A walk down Main Street allows you to stop by the bank, purchase homemade cupcakes or bring home treats for your dog, then walk across the street to pick up your prescription at the downtown CVS pharmacy. It's the best of both worlds.
