# Tasteful Arts and Entertainment

### Visual Art
A haven for visual artists, the Greenville community supports many independent studios, some nationally recognized. Local events like First Fridays, highlight the variety and liveliness of the art scene by encouraging artists to open their studios to the public. Once a year, Artisphere, a curated open-air art festival, draws both local and national artists to downtown Greenville.

### Theatre & Dance
From community theatre to national tours, Greenville offers a broad performing arts experience. You can find Broadway shows like Les Miserables and The Lion King at The Peace Center. For a unique outdoor theatre experience, check out Shakespeare in the Park, a summer play series performed in Falls Park. Greenville's got you covered, whether you're a fan of ballet, comedy or interactive theater.

### Music
Greenville's downtown arena, the Bilo Center, attracts national acts including The Avett Brothers, Josh Groban, Prince and Guns N’ Roses. You can find a more intimate music setting at The Handlebar, just three blocks from Main Street. Digging some live jazz? Head over to the Brown Street Club, an upscale venue in the heart of downtown.

### Museums
Greenville is home to many great museums for enrichment and education. Families can engage in fun educational activities at the Children’s Museum. The giant Light Brite and complex waterworks are not to be missed. For art connoisseurs, the Greenville County Museum of Art (free admission) features works from greats such as Andrew Wyeth, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol.

###Festivals & Events 
Greenvillians love to celebrate art, food, and community. A couple of examples include the Indie Craft Parade, which draws hordes of visitors to showcase and celebrate handmade goods. Each October, Fall for Greenville packs out the Main Street strip for a weekend of local food, music, rides and revelry.
