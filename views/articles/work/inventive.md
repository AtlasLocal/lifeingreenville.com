## Craftsmanship & technical ingenuity

You might say Greenville is a Southern anomaly: a hotbed of technical entrepreneurship and creative talent. If you’re looking to work on something meaningful, something unique, Greenville is the perfect place to start.

### A Community of Makers

Whether you’re looking to join an innovative creative agency such as Brains on Fire or team up with an engineering powerhouse like BMW, Greenville has more than its fair share of big opportunities. Or if joining a profitable craftsman culture with independent creators is more your style, rest assured you’ll be in good company.  You’ll find a diversity of talented artists, designers, illustrators, and creators collaborating throughout Greenville’s downtown area, nearby arts district, and shared work spaces like CoWork Greenville, White Whale Studios, or the NEXT Innovation Center.
