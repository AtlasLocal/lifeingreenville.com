# Prosperous

## Subheading/tagline here

Once the textile capital of the world, Greenville was forced to innovate itself out of a dying industry. Today, Greenville is no stranger to lofty accolades - "#1 Micro City of the Future", "Nations #1 Metro for Economic Growth Potential", "One of the Best Cities for Jobs", "Number One City for Foreign Investment". But these accolades are just symptoms. Symptoms of Greenville’s grit, Greenville’s determination for prosperity and change.  With a growing list of over 100 Fortune 500 companies and 200 foreign based firms calling Greenville home, you can feel the hard-earned momentum.
