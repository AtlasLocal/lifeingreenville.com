### An Evening in Greenville, SC

Greenville is brimming with unique restaurants. Staying downtown at the Hyatt or The Westin Poinsett, you can hit a wide range of cuisines all within a ten minute walking distance. Start out on North Main and check out [The Green Room](http://www.thegreenroomupstate.com/) for a couple of appetizers and glass of wine. If you're feeling fun, try the calamari. Wrap up there and head south down Main to [The Trappe Door](http://trappedoor.com/) for a beer and another appetizer or two. The beer list is long enough to satisfy any taste, and the scallops are an excellent choice for sampling their Belgian cuisine. Top off your evening by walking down to the Reedy River on South Main. [The Lazy Goat](http://thelazygoat.typepad.com/) is the perfect finale featuring a wide list of Mediterranean appetizers and dishes paired with excellent wine options. For the last taste of Greenville try the hummus or finish with gelato for dessert. Sit outside if it's summer, you won't regret it. When you're ready to close out the evening you can catch a trolley back to North Main, or take 10 minutes to walk back up to where you started by The Green Room.


## Curious? Spend a Weekend.
