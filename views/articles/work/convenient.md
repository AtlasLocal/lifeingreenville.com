# Convenient

## 15 Minutes to Anywhere

In Greenville, you can work downtown and live minutes away, affordably.  Lunch meetings downtown are as simple as a 5 minute drive or walk and afterwork entertainment is just as easy.  CoWork Greenville is a great example of this.  CoWork is a collaborative working space 5 minutes from the heart of downtown, filled with technology professionals working and collaborating independently on cutting edge projects.  

When visitors come to town for meetings they can cheaply stay within walking distance to office spaces and downtown attractions.  There is also a just the right size airport 15 minutes from downtown with service by Southwest Air for cheap flights all over the country.  

If you decide to live outside of town there is rarely traffic into and out of town and houses are priced very affordability.

* visitors - Southwest, airport nearby, affordable stay, good location
* spaces-  affordability, availability, collaborative, good location
* short commutes
